# Gulp Boilerplate

This is a simple boilerplate that I created to use on personal projects.

This boilerplate was created using the following technologies:

* Yarn
* Gulp
* Sass
* Node

## Getting started

To use this boilerplate on your project, clone this repo and run on root folder the command `yarn` or `npm install`.

This command will install all dependencies that you will need to run gulp tasks.
